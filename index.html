               <h2>GILLAINE MAE COLLADO</h2>
               <p>I am Gillaine Mae Rosario Collado student from Pangasinan State University majoring Computer Engineering. 
               It took me basically forever to decide what I wanted to major in, but I finally settled on Engineering.
               Describing myself is one of the toughest tasks to do, but it’s fascinating too, to put it to words.
               I believe our traits – be they positive or negative – make us the person we are to the world.
               When it comes to my personality, people can have different opinions because they see what they want to see in me,
               and that’s okay.Describing myself is one of the toughest tasks to do, but it’s fascinating too, to put it to words.

                        <p>Life is all about to achieve, and what should we achieve? Happiness.Psychologists say, “The pursuit of world is happiness.
                            And you can understand whatever we do that is linked with attaining happiness.</p>
                            Life is a wonderfully exciting journey filled with loads of uncertainities and sudden trips. But how well can one drive along is what matters.. you can fight along, bypass, avoid or do anything of the route to reach your destination. Its a journey of possibilities and opportunities.
                            Completeness of life is again person dependent, but with one golden rule.. Everyday live it your way and give the best to whatever you are upto. Who knows about tomorrow.. Laugh heartily Love crazily.. Dream and live your dreams.
